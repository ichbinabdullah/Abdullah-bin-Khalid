# Security risk assessment report 

# Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Disable unused ports:-Ports can be blocked on firewalls, routers, servers, and more to prevent potentially dangerous network traffic from passing through.
Firewall maintenance:- Firewall maintenance entails checking and updating security configurations regularly to stay ahead of potential threats.
Multifactor authentication (MFA):-A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. MFA options include a password, pin number, badge, one-time password (OTP) sent to a cell phone, fingerprint, and more.
Password policies:-The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) latest recommendations for password policies focuses on using methods to salt and hash passwords, rather than requiring overly complex passwords or enforcing frequent changes to passwords.
Port filtering:- A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.

# Part 2: Explain your recommendations
I recommend that they must maintain their firewall and further they need to change their password policy and the admin password is secret and different from the other employers password. They should restrict the firewall policy and set the traffic on firewall. They must use the multifactor authentication method to prevent data breaching.
